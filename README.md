A place to experiment and play about with images!

##CImg
The CImg Library is an image processing library, designed for C++ programmers. It provides useful classes and functions to load/save, display and process various types of images.

You can view the documentation to CImg here: http://cimg.eu/reference/modules.html

It's a good idea to use CImg to get rid of all the extra work that comes with loading, saving and displaying an image in C++ so we can soley focus our attention on the image processing part.
